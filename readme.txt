This is an extremely lightweight plugin that will allow you to drop a recurring South America Mission donation form on your website.

== Description ==

Hello fellow SAM missionary!  I hope that this plugin will prove useful for raising your support on your WordPress site.

After installing, you will need two things:

- The name of the missionary or SAM project
- The account number for that missionary or project

In the left hand menu, click on `Plugins`, then `SAM Donate`.

Enter your information and after entering these, simply drop this shortcode into a post or page, and your form will show up.
`[sam-donate]`

If you have access to your theme's template files and wish to put this form into your theme directly, use this PHP code:
`do_shortcode('[sam-donate]')`

== Installation ==

1. Upload `sam-donation.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `[sam-donate]` in your posts or pages.  If you have access to your theme's template files and wish to put this form into your theme directly, use this PHP code: `do_shortcode('[sam-donate]')`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find my SAM account number? =

Go [here](http://www.southamericamission.org/index.php?page=GIVE+THROUGH+SAM) and find the correct group, clicking on your name, project, ministry, or field, and looking at the very bottom of the right column.

= What types of donations can people make? =

Users can use the form to make monthly, quarterly, yearly, or one-time donations using their credit card.

= How is the transaction processed? =

SAM processes all online credit card donations through a secure 3rd party merchant.  After the donation has finished, they will be redirected to South America Mission's website.

You can email me directly at cmweissenberger@southamericamission.org if you have any issues with the plugin.
